# LearningCards

This is the website for learning new words.

Most of all, this project helps you to save words you want to learn and information for their better learning: translation or difinition, transcription, exapmle of usage. All this information is contained in the "card"

To simplify the learning process and add a bit of structure, you can add "cards" to groups at your discretion.

If you have a lot of words to add and you don't want to add them manually you can write everything in excel-file and add it in one click.

On the main page you can sort "cards" by groups and by status of their learning.
