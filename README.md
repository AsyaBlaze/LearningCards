# LearningCards

This is the website for learning new words.
Most of all this project helps you to save words you want to learn and information for their better learning: translation or difinition, transcription, exapmle of usage. All together it's card.
To make your learning process easier and add a little bit of structure you can add cards in groups as you like.
If you have a lot of words to add and you don't want to add them manually you can write everything in excel-file and add it in one click.
On the main page you can sort cards by groups and by status of their learning.
